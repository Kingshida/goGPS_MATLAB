# Fill the credentials with your users and passwords
# To add security remember to change the permission on this file to be readable by only your user

# If you add the credentials.txt file and don't want to see the file changed in git remember to run:
# "git update-index --assume-unchanged credentials.txt"
# from the goGPS folder
